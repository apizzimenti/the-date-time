##The Date Time
I decided to do a little project, inspired by a text clock I found on r/webdev the other day. It only uses JS, HTML, 
and CSS (with a little jQ thrown in, of course).

###Finally
I waited a long time for my next project, and I decided that this would be the one. I worked endlessly (for about four 
hours) and found it to be quite fun, working on these things. Anyways, the project is finished and I'll be publishing 
updates regularly.
